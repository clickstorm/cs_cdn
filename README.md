# [clickstorm] CDN
 
The cs_cdn Extension replaces local file references in the html page with references to remote files, allowing to host files on a Content Delivery Netwerk (CDN) server. It is possible to activate a button with the delete Key CDN cache function.
 
Feel free to test and give feedback.
